Idea 1: Do the capital spend or investments by Facebook have any effect on Facebook's stock performance? I'm trying to understand if there is a head and shoulders pattern that can be discern out of the price movement of FB given a period of time (assuming after a big investment such as VR, video on Messenger, etc.). Investors would be interested since the price of FB (39x earnings) is not as expensive as Amazon's stock price. Data source can be Yahoo Finance or Nasdaq, perhaps others. But this would also require looking at the 10k filings of FB from SEC.

Idea 2: How do banks know which loans to maintain or sell when students graduate? This is billions of dollar market for financial sector. Ownership of loan contracts change hands frequently. I wonder how many times students' loan contracts change hands. At what point does a lender sell the contract and a new lender buy the contract? I'm not sure what dataset and source to use. Is there a secondary market data for student loans?    

Idea 3: Does extreme weather condition and distance affect casino patrons' decisions to visit casino properties?
Most casinos are in the warm areas in California state. I'm interested with the Indian casinos in the southern part of California. In particular, a client of mine in San Bernardino may be a good candidate. This casino uses patron management system that contains data about the patrons' biographic info, points/credits, address, visits, etc. 

Idea 4: Does store location really matter when buying lotto tickets?
There is a belief among bettors that stores that previously generated winning tickets have far more chances of winning than the others. California Lotto has attracted bettors all over the state, and has produced hundreds of millions, if not billions, of winning pot. Can a bettor gain an advantage over the others when betting in a winning store?
I believe Califronia Lotto has database of winning numbers and store locations where those winning numbers were purchased.
